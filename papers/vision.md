# Gavagai: Interpretive AGI from the Ground Up

## Premise

Modern LLMs lack beliefs, desires, and intentions. We aim to go beyond prediction toward interpretive understanding.

## Philosophical Roots

- **Quine**: Holism and indeterminacy of translation
- **Davidson**: Interpretation as the source of meaning
- **Normative Cognition**: Beliefs and desires as rational descriptions

## Plan

1. Annotate real-world dialogues with propositional attitudes
2. Train models to infer beliefs holophrastically (sentence-level)
3. Analyze structures of rational coherence and triangulated reference

## Long-Term Vision

Agents that don't just say things that *sound* right, but that *mean* themâ€”in a normatively describable sense.

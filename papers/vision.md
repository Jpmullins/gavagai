# Gavagai: Interpretive AGI from the Ground Up

## Vision

Modern LLMs generate plausible text but lack beliefs, desires, and intentions in the sense required for genuine interpretive understanding. Gavagai aims to move beyond prediction toward building agents whose behavior can be described in terms of propositional attitudes and normatively rational patterns, following Davidson and Quine.

## Step-by-Step Plan for Triangulation RL

1. **Clarify Conceptual Requirements**
   - Multi-agent, iterative adjustment of beliefs, desires, intentions (triangulation)
   - Bayesian-RL integration for updating attitudes
   - Normative rationality via coherence constraints
2. **Architectural Outline**
   - Agents with modular cognitive architecture: Bayesian belief, utility, intention, and interaction modules
   - World model with dynamic latent-state and counterfactual reasoning
3. **Technical Methodologies**
   - Bayesian RL, Multi-Agent RL, Inverse RL/RLHF
   - Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Hierarchical Bayesian models
   - Logical coherence checking, rational belief revision
   - Multi-agent and language-based simulation environments
4. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up a multi-agent simulation environment
   - Prototype a Bayesian belief-updating agent
   - Implement RL integration for utilities, intentions, and additional attitudes

## Long-Term Vision

To engineer agents that do not merely produce plausible language, but whose actions and utterances can be truly described as meaningful, intentional, and rational in the Davidsonian/Quinean sense. The ultimate goal is artificial agents capable of radical interpretation, normativity, and genuine participation in the space of reasonsâ€”not just the space of predictions.

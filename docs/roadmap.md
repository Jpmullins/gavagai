# Gavagai Project Roadmap: Triangulation RL

## 1. Clarify Conceptual Requirements
- Triangulation: Multi-agent, iterative adjustment of beliefs, desires, intentions
- Bayesian-RL integration for propositional attitude updates
- Normative rationality via coherence constraints

## 2. Architectural Outline
- Agents with modular cognitive architecture: Bayesian belief, utility, intention, and interaction modules
- World model with dynamic latent-state and counterfactual reasoning

## 3. Technical Methodologies
- Bayesian RL, Multi-Agent RL, Inverse RL/RLHF
- Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Hierarchical Bayesian models
- Logical coherence checking, rational belief revision
- Multi-agent and language-based simulation environments

## 4. Immediate Actions
- Set up a multi-agent simulation environment (OpenSpiel, Gym, or custom)
- Prototype a Bayesian belief-updating agent
- Implement RL integration for utilities, intentions, and additional attitudes

## 5. Iterative Testing & Documentation
- Develop benchmarks and tests for rational patterning and intentional ascription
- Maintain clear philosophical and technical documentation for all contributors

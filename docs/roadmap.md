# Gavagai Project Roadmap

## 1. Project Overhaul
- Remove legacy code and files focused on text classification or unrelated tasks.
- Refactor codebase to align with the new philosophical and engineering goals.

## 2. Literature Review
- Summarize key works by Davidson, Quine, and related thinkers.
- Identify computational analogues and prior work in AI, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.

## 3. Design Principles
- Formalize requirements for rational, intentional behavior in artificial agents.
- Define evaluation criteria for normativity, radical interpretation, and compositional semantics.

## 4. Prototype Development
- Explore architectures that support radical interpretation, normativity, and compositional semantics.
- Develop initial prototypes and testbeds.

## 5. Iterative Testing
- Develop benchmarks and tests for rational patterning and intentional ascription.
- Refine models and evaluation methods based on results.

## 6. Documentation
- Maintain clear philosophical and technical documentation for all contributors.
- Update `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `README.md` as the project evolves.

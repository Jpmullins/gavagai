# Project Purpose and Philosophical Foundations

## Purpose
This project aims to engineer an artificial agent that is not merely a text classifier or language model, but a system whose behavior can be described in terms of propositional attitudes—beliefs, desires, intentions—following the philosophical insights of Donald Davidson and W.V.O. Quine. The goal is to build a model that exhibits normatively rational patterns of behavior, such that psychological (intentional) descriptions are true of it, not just mechanistic or physical ones.

## Philosophical Foundations
- **Rational Structure**: Inspired by Davidson, the project treats psychological descriptions (belief, desire, intention) as imposing a rational structure on behavior, supervening on but not reducible to physical mechanisms.
- **Normativity**: The agent should act in ways that fit into rational patterns, not just produce sentences. Its outputs should be interpretable as rational, intentional actions.
- **Radical Interpretation**: Drawing from Quine and Davidson, the agent should be capable of radical interpretation—assigning propositional attitudes to others and itself through intersubjective triangulation.
- **Naturalism**: The approach is naturalistic (per Quine), focusing on how language and thought emerge from social interaction and environmental triangulation, not from innate mechanisms or internal representations alone.
- **Compositional Semantics**: The project explores how LLMs can move beyond stochastic text generation to simulate the logical and recursive constraints of rational, intentional descriptions.

## Engineering Goal
To engineer a system that is, in principle, capable of being described as a thinking thing: one that can ascribe and self-ascribe beliefs, desires, intentions, and meaning, and whose behavior fits into normatively rational patterns as described by Davidsonian/Quinean philosophy.

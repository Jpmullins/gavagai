# Gavagai: Triangulation RL Agents

Inspired by Quine and Davidson, Gavagai aims to engineer agents whose behavior can be described in terms of propositional attitudes—beliefs, desires, intentions—emerging from dynamic, multi-agent interaction and rational normativity.

## Project Overview
Gavagai is a research project to build agents that fit into normatively rational patterns, enabling radical interpretation and triangulation. The approach integrates Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, and philosophical insights from Davidson and Quine.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Clarify Conceptual Requirements
- **Triangulation:** Multi-agent, iterative adjustment of propositional attitudes
- **Bayesian-RL Integration:** Belief, desire, and intention updates via Bayesian inference and RL
- **Normative Rationality:** Coherence constraints for meaningful, stable attitudes

### 2. Architectural Outline

│
├── Agents (interpreters and interpretees)
│     ├── Cognitive Architecture
│     │     ├── Bayesian Belief System
│     │     ├── Utility (Desires/Expected Utility)
│     │     ├── Intention Module
│     │     └── Connotative/Additional Attitudes (optional)
│     └── World Interaction Module
│           ├── Language generation (LLM)
│           ├── Action generation (simulated environments)
│           └── Perception modules
└── World Model (dynamic latent-state, counterfactual reasoning)
```

### 3. Technical Requirements
- Bayesian RL, Multi-Agent RL, Inverse RL/RLHF
- Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Hierarchical Bayesian models
- Logical coherence checking, rational belief revision
- Multi-agent and language-based simulation environments

### 4. Immediate Actions
- Set up a multi-agent simulation environment
- Prototype a Bayesian belief-updating agent
- Implement RL integration for utilities, intentions, and additional attitudes

## Contributing
See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the philosophical and technical background. All contributions should align with the triangulation RL plan and rationalist/naturalist orientation.

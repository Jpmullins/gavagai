**Interpretive AGI from the Ground Up**

Inspired by Quine and Davidson, Gavagai explores how agents can learn *belief*, *desire*, and *intention* not as predefined states, but as emergent patterns from empirical learning. This project aims to:

- Represent propositional attitudes holophrastically
- Anchor meaning through intersubjective triangulation
- Model rational normativity and interpretive understanding

> “Meaning is not in the head. It is in the act of interpretation.”

This repository includes:
- A growing dataset of annotated dialogues
- Baseline models for learning interpretive structure
- Philosophical framing and technical vision

Collaborators welcome.
